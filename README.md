# VoltApply n8n Workflow Backups

This repository contains JSON exports of n8n workflows developed as part of the **VoltApply Automation System** — an AI-powered solution to streamline job applications across LinkedIn and other platforms.

### 🚀 Project Purpose

VoltApply is a 14-day sprint project to automate and enhance the job application process by leveraging:
- 🧠 AI resume parsing (via Gemini API)
- 🔁 FastAPI and Redis for backend orchestration
- 🤖 LinkedIn & job portal automation using Puppeteer
- ⚙️ n8n as the central orchestrator

This repository serves as a **version-controlled backup** for all n8n workflows developed throughout the sprint.
